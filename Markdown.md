| Column 1 | Column 2 |

## This Line Is for Scripting Styles
1. Now I can have an Italic
   *lets check if it comes out as Italic?*
   _Lets Check If this One Also Is Italic_

2. Now we want a Bold Text
   **Is this Bold enough?**
   __Or This One is BOLD__

Now we want to indicate something is removed by a line in the script
~~This line has been removed~~

### This One Is for Lists
**I want to create a list here**

1. This is the one
2. This is the two
3. This is the three
4. This is the four

- I want to add the list
- This list is my first attempt
- I don’t like that I’m not moving fast enough now
- I need to make sure it’s working

CTRL + D is removing on VS, just to know we can select and do it
